## Abstract

- The nnUNet model was used to segment the aorta (aortic region).

- The segmented aorta area was analyzed based on its area and pixel intensity values to determine whether it is in an enhanced or non-enhanced state.

- Additional information, such as axial, sagittal, and coronal views, was extracted from the DICOM header.

- The extracted DICOM tag information was compared with a pre-existing reference dataset to evaluate the accuracy of the analysis results.


## Description

![model_description](model_image.png)

## Usage Notes

### Requirements

- pytorch (latest version)
- matplotlib 3.3.4
- SimpleITK 1.2.4

### Inference

`%cd nnUNet_v2_inference_lowres
!python DataExtraction_CSV_subprocess.py -input_dcm '../dcm_input' -gpu_num 1`

- `-input_dcm`: Input folder location of CXR images.
- `-gpu_num`: Enter the GPU number to be used.

The result is It is created as an output.csv file in nnUNet_v2_inference_lowres..

## Summary

The nnUNet model was used for aortic segmentation and analysis, incorporating pixel intensity, multi-view DICOM data, and reference dataset comparison.
## Tag(Input)

DICOM

## Tag(Purpose)

Segmentation, Evaluation

## Reference

The nnUNet model was trained using in-house data from Asan Medical Center (AMC), which includes a large set of curated medical images for aorta segmentation.
